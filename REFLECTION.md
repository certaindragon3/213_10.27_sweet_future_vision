# Reflection: A Future Where We All Walk Freely

When I close my eyes and imagine the future, I don't see flying cars or towering cities. I see people walking—slowly, peacefully, without rush. This project is for everyone who feels trapped in the relentless pace of modern life, everyone who dreams of a world where we can finally breathe.

I chose oranges as the central metaphor because they represent something beautifully ordinary. We are all oranges—simple, sweet, and meant to exist without pressure. In a world that constantly demands productivity and perfection, I wanted to remind us that we're allowed to just *be*. This matters deeply to me because I've watched friends burn out, I've felt the weight of expectations, and I've longed for permission to slow down.

The horizontal scroll was intentional—it breaks the endless vertical feeds we're so used to. Instead of scrolling mindlessly downward, you move sideways, deliberately, like taking steps on a journey. Each section is a breath, a pause. The walking orange stays with you throughout, a gentle companion reminding you that progress doesn't have to be rushed.

I started with grey (#FBF8EF)—not harsh black, but a soft, tired grey—because that's where many of us are now. Then the colors gradually bloom: teal (#80CBC4) for the first whispers of hope, aqua (#B4EBE6) for joy beginning to spread, and finally golden (#FFB433) for a future where everyone glows with inner peace. These aren't loud, demanding colors. They're soft and welcoming, like sunrise.

The haikus speak in whispers, not declarations. "Together, we breathe." "Small joys start to bloom." "Peace glows from within." I wanted language that feels like a friend's hand on your shoulder, saying: it's okay. We'll get there.

This design is my love letter to a gentler future—one where we're not constantly running, but simply walking, together, toward light.
